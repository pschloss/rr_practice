## How to fold a paper airplane

1. Obtain an 8.5" x 11" white piece of paper
2. Fold the paper length-wise so that it is now a 4.25" x 11" rectangle - make a sharp crease
3. Open the paper and two corners that are on one of the short ends and fold them to the first crease. You should now have a rectangle with a pointy end
4. Take the same end with the point, and fold the two sides again towards the center line so that you have an even sharper point
5. Refold the paper along the original crease from step 2. It should look a bit like a triangle with a rectangle attached
6. With the point sitting to the left, fold the top edge down towards the bottom to make the first wing.
7. With the point sitting to the right, fold the top edge of the other side down towards the bottom to make the second wing.
8. Flatten the wings so that they are perpindicular to the body of the plane.
9. Use crayons or sharpies to decorate your plane
10. Toss plane!
